    "# === Introduction ===\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this problem, you will again build a planner that helps a robot\n",
    "#   find the best path through a warehouse filled with boxes\n",
    "#   that it has to pick up and deliver to a dropzone. Unlike Part A,\n",
    "#   however, in this problem the robot is moving in a continuous world\n",
    "#   (albeit in discrete time steps) and has constraints on the amount\n",
    "#   it can turn its wheels in a given time step.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Your file must be called `partB.py` and must have a class\n",
    "#   called `DeliveryPlanner`.\n",
    "# This class must have an `__init__` function that takes five \n",
    "#   arguments: `self`, `warehouse`, `todo`, `max_distance`, and\n",
    "#   `max_steering`.\n",
    "# The class must also have a function called `plan_delivery` that \n",
    "#   takes a single argument, `self`.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Input Specifications ===\n",
    "# \n",
    "# `warehouse` will be a list of m strings, each with n characters,\n",
    "#   corresponding to the layout of the warehouse. The warehouse is an\n",
    "#   m x n grid. warehouse[i][j] corresponds to the spot in the ith row\n",
    "#   and jth column of the warehouse, where the 0th row is the northern\n",
    "#   end of the warehouse and the 0th column is the western end.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The characters in each string will be one of the following:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# '.' (period) : traversable space.\n",
    "# '#' (hash) : a wall. If the robot contacts a wall space, it will crash.\n",
    "# '@' (dropzone): the space where all boxes must be delivered. The dropzone may be traversed like \n",
    "#   a '.' space.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Each space is a 1 x 1 block. The upper-left corner of space warehouse[i][j] is at the point (j,-i) in\n",
    "#   the plane. Spaces outside the warehouse are considered walls; if any part of the robot leaves the \n",
    "#   warehouse, it will be considered to have crashed into the exterior wall of the warehouse.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# For example, \n",
    "#   warehouse = ['.#.',\n",
    "#                '.#.',\n",
    "#                '..@']\n",
    "#   is a 3x3 warehouse. The dropzone is at space (2,-2) and there are walls at spaces (1,0) \n",
    "#   and (1,-1). The rest of the warehouse is empty space.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The robot is a circle of radius 0.25. The robot begins centered in the dropzone space.\n",
    "#   The robot's initial bearing is 0.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The argument `todo` is a list of points representing the center point of each box.\n",
    "#   todo[0] is the first box which must be delivered, followed by todo[1], and so on.\n",
    "#   Each box is a square of size 0.2 x 0.2. If the robot contacts a box, it will crash.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The arguments `max_distance` and `max_steering` are parameters constraining the movement\n",
    "#   of the robot on a given time step. They are described more below.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Rules for Movement ===\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - The robot may move any distance between 0 and `max_distance` per time step.\n",
    "# - The robot may set its steering angle anywhere between -`max_steering` and \n",
    "#   `max_steering` per time step. A steering angle of 0 means that the robot will\n",
    "#   move according to its current bearing. A positive angle means the robot will \n",
    "#   turn counterclockwise by `steering_angle` radians; a negative steering_angle \n",
    "#   means the robot will turn clockwise by abs(steering_angle) radians.\n",
    "# - Upon a movement, the robot will change its steering angle instantaneously to the \n",
    "#   amount indicated by the move, and then it will move a distance in a straight line in its\n",
    "#   new bearing according to the amount indicated move.\n",
    "# - The cost per move is 1 plus the amount of distance traversed by the robot on that move.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - The robot may pick up a box whose center point is within 0.5 units of the robot's center point.\n",
    "# - If the robot picks up a box, it incurs a total cost of 2 for that move (this already includes \n",
    "#   the 1-per-move cost incurred by the robot).\n",
    "# - While holding a box, the robot may not pick up another box.\n",
    "# - The robot may put a box down at a total cost of 1.5 for that move. The box must be placed so that:\n",
    "#   - The box is not contacting any walls, the exterior of the warehouse, any other boxes, or the robot\n",
    "#   - The box's center point is within 0.5 units of the robot's center point\n",
    "# - A box is always oriented so that two of its edges are horizontal and the other two are vertical.\n",
    "# - If a box is placed entirely within the '@' space, it is considered delivered and is removed from the \n",
    "#   warehouse.\n",
    "# - The warehouse will be arranged so that it is always possible for the robot to move to the \n",
    "#   next box on the todo list without having to rearrange any other boxes.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - If the robot crashes, it will stop moving and incur a cost of 100*distance, where distance\n",
    "#   is the length it attempted to move that move. (The regular movement cost will not apply.)\n",
    "# - If an illegal move is attempted, the robot will not move, but the standard cost will be incurred.\n",
    "#   Illegal moves include (but are not necessarily limited to):\n",
    "#     - picking up a box that doesn't exist or is too far away\n",
    "#     - picking up a box while already holding one\n",
    "#     - putting down a box too far away or so that it's touching a wall, the warehouse exterior, \n",
    "#       another box, or the robot\n",
    "#     - putting down a box while not holding a box\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Output Specifications ===\n",
    "#\n",
    "# `plan_delivery` should return a LIST of strings, each in one of the following formats.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 'move {steering} {distance}', where '{steering}' is a floating-point number between\n",
    "#   -`max_steering` and `max_steering` (inclusive) and '{distance}' is a floating-point\n",
    "#   number between 0 and `max_distance`\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 'lift {b}', where '{b}' is replaced by the index in the list `todo` of the box being picked up\n",
    "#   (so if you intend to lift box 0, you would return the string 'lift 0')\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 'down {x} {y}', where '{x}' is replaced by the x-coordinate of the center point of where the box\n",
    "#   will be placed and where '{y}' is replaced by the y-coordinate of that center point\n",
    "#   (for example, 'down 1.5 -2.9' means to place the box held by the robot so that its center point\n",
    "#   is (1.5,-2.9)).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Grading ===\n",
    "# \n",
    "# - Your planner will be graded against a set of test cases, each equally weighted.\n",
    "# - Each task will have a \"baseline\" cost. If your set of moves results in the task being completed\n",
    "#   with a total cost of K times the baseline cost, you will receive 1/K of the credit for the\n",
    "#   test case. (Note that if K < 1, this means you earn extra credit!)\n",
    "# - Otherwise, you will receive no credit for that test case. This could happen for one of several \n",
    "#   reasons including (but not necessarily limited to):\n",
    "#   - plan_delivery's moves do not deliver the boxes in the correct order.\n",
    "#   - plan_delivery's output is not a list of strings in the prescribed format.\n",
    "#   - plan_delivery does not return an output within the prescribed time limit.\n",
    "#   - Your code raises an exception.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# === Additional Info ===\n",
    "# \n",
    "# - You may add additional classes and functions as needed provided they are all in the file `partB.py`.\n",
    "# - Your partB.py file must not execute any code when it is imported. \n",
    "# - Upload partB.py to Project 2 on T-Square in the Assignments section. Do not put it into an \n",
    "#   archive with other files.\n",
    "# - Ask any questions about the directions or specifications on Piazza.\n",
