1. We had a robot that localizing itself.
2. Let's talk about how to sense other cars. How fast are they moving etc.
3. Understanding where the cars are. 

    KALMAN FILTER CLASS
  -----------------------

 - Car uses lasers and radars to sense other cars.
 - Avoid collision in the future. Bicycle, pedestrians, and cars
 - Kalman Filter to tracking. To estimate the state.

 - Kalman filter is continious. Monte Carlo Localization is discrete.
 - Kalman is uni-modal. Monte Carlo is multi modal.
 - Google self-driving car uses Kalman Filter Class
